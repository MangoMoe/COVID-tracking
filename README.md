# COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool

## About this project
[Main App Here](https://analytics-modeling.shinyapps.io/outbreakdetection/)

The COVID-19 Outbreak Detection Tool detects recent COVID-19 outbreaks in U.S. counties. The tool leverages machine learning to predict how fast an outbreak could spread at the county level by estimating the doubling time of COVID-19 cases. It accounts for reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, face mask mandates, social distancing policies, the CDCâ€™s Social Vulnerability Index, changes in tests performed and rate of positive tests. The tool offers an interactive map and a data explorer allowing users to filter and rearrange counties based on predicted trends, which get updated at least once per week.
