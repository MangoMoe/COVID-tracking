problems:

not symmetric somewhere (but everywhere I have looked so far it is
Huge magnitudes in some areas...



subsampling to get approximate covariance

average covariances for each file

remove irellevant things like id numbers

cross validation
	verify that you can use a smaller sample size


binomial distribution

binary doesn't count



run the model!!!!!! see how long it will take

replace some columns with the average or the most frequent or something


dimensionality reduction
	just find variance, if small enough just replace with the mean


sharpness equation

	mean / variance 
	how varied actually is it
